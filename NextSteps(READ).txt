Your next steps would be:

1. Download Data: Get IEMOCAP or CREMA-D and place the relevant audio files/folders into data/raw/.

2. Adapt data_loader.py: Modify find_audio_files and parse_label_from_filepath to correctly locate your audio files
and extract their emotion labels based on the specific dataset's structure and naming conventions. 
Focus on identifying the labels relevant to your project (especially frustration, anger, neutral).

3. Run data_loader.py: Execute the script to process the raw audio into segments.

4.  feature_extractor.py: Review the feature parameters (N_MFCC, N_FFT, etc.). 
You might need to add padding/truncation logic here or in the data loader
to ensure all feature vectors/matrices have consistent dimensions for model input.

5. Run feature_extractor.py: Execute the script to generate MFCC and Spectrogram features from the processed segments.

6. Explore Data (notebooks/): Use the notebooks to load the features and labels, visualize them, and understand the data distribution.

7. Implement train.py and evaluate.py: Write the scripts to load features/labels, instantiate a model from model.py, train it, 
evaluate its performance using metrics from scikit-learn.

8. Refine Models (model.py): Adjust the model architectures based on initial results and exploration.
